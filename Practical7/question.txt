Question: How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain?
line number of the related codes start:44
discussion of the result: 
Everything goes well except some parts of the date below the x axis can't be seen directly.
As the figure shows, the #new cases becomes larger quickily at the beginning of March and reduces at the end.
While the total cases goes higher dramatically in the March, because it is the cumulative value of the new case.
