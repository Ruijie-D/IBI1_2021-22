Compare to the former practicals, this practical is more difficult for me. 
I have spent a great amount of time doing it. Fortunately, everything goes well finally.
The most challeging thing I have met is moving files from local address to the GitHub.
I tried many times and tried to get help from the "helper" command, but it didn't work.
I also searched the problem on the Internet,but I didn't find the solutions.
Fotunately, it was a problem many of us met, and robert offered a solution, and it worked out.
I have one question:
When we use the command "git merge", a new page will appear, and the instruxtion says we can use "x" to quit. 
But for me, it didn't work.
I wonder do we have other solutions?
