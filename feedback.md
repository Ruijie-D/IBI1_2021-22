In week 4 directory, I didn't change anything and it seems fine.

In week 5 directory:
 In variables.py, I changed to "X and Y" and added more combinations of them.
 In mystery_code.py, I improved my comment with adding "it prints the 10th number" instead of the random one.
 in pizza_party.py, I changed for loop to while loop, so that the circling number need not to be defined in advance.

In week 6 directory:
 In paternalage.py, I changed the input ways of the dictionary rlsp (using two lists instead), so that the dictionary data can be updated with the two lists.
                    I added pseudocode in line 13 to explain what I want to do next
 In robsmark.py, I corrected a typing error: changed "6" to "60"
